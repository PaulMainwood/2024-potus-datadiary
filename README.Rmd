# 2024-potus
repo for constructing a 2024 presidential election forecast

### loose methodology

Vaguely, the following:

* Set priors based on time-for-change model in each state & at the national level
* 'Predict' each poll's result
* Utilize a poisson likelihood for each candidate (D/R/O)
* simplex of probabilities - use other as the pivot
* each candidate gets their own linear model
* Linear model has offset terms for pollster, mode, population, state, and date
* state offset is set by a gaussian process using mahalonobis distance between the states
* date offset is set by a gaussian process over time

### loose workflow

* targeted workflow
* FRED data feed into priors
* tidycensus data feed into priors
* FTE pulled in for polling
* Exclusion of Traflagar, Rasmussen, Center Street 
* GH action for publishing

### references

* Linzer 2013 paper
* Pierre Kemp 2016 model
* Economist 2020 model
* Abramovitz time-for-change
* FTE
* FRED
* Census

### notes on abramovitz data

* Incumbent net approval pulled from FiveThirtyEight's averages on the day before the presidential election. If the exact date is not available due to data resolution, (these are manually pulled) the net approval from the closest day *prior* to election day is used instead.
* Third party flag is set to 1 whenever an individual third party candidate garners more than 5% of the national popular vote.
* Abramovitz 2012 mod can be found [here](https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/files/2012/08/abramowitz.pdf)
